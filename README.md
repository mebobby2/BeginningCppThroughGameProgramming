## Compilation
1. To compile each of the individual C++ programs, use g++, e.g. g++ chapter1/expensive_calculator.cpp
2. This will create an executable called a.out in the root directory. You can then run the program by using ./a.out

## How C++ code works
1. You use an editor to write C++ code
2. The source code is then feed into a Compiler, which outputs object code
3. The object code is feed into a Linker, which outputs a executable file
4. You can then run the executable file

## What is a linker?
A linker links the object file to any external files as necessary, and then creates the executable file.
